$post1 = ["MICDS Robotics Team 2015-2016", "Greetings to all those reading this for the first time! Our MICDS Robotics team has split into two parts this year, one co-ed team and another all female team to (hopefully) bolster the amount of girls participating in STEM activities. This website, however is for the Co-Ed team. With a very complex challenge to overcome, our team has come up with so many ideas that we cannot put them in one robot! Instead, we've split our construction teams into the X-team and the Alpha team! The Alpha team, aided by the 3D printing team is focused on debris pickup and transportation while the X-team is focused on designing an innovative way to climb the ramp and tip our flag at the top! Although it may seem like our focus is divided, both of our construction teams are focused and prepared for competition! Once we get through our first competition, we'll decide which robot is best for the team or combine both robots to the best of our abilities! Our current leaders are Matthew Currie (CEO - Chief Executive Officer), Jackson White (CCO - Chief Constructing Officer), Bob Sforza (CTO - Chief Technological Officer), and Charles Biggs (COO - Chief Organizational Officer). Each officer, save for the CEO, is delegated to a specific group in the Robotics team. The CCO is in charge of all construction; the CTO is in charge of both programming and 3D printing; the CCO is in charge of the notebook, website, and community outreach. With this system in place, our team has been working much more efficiently than it has previously, and we are looking forward to how this year goes for us!", "http://micdsrobotics.com/img/dummies/blog/RobotAlpha.jpg"];
$post2 = ["3D Printing", "Our 3D printing team has had ample opportunity, thanks to funding by our school, to invest in the latest printers for our lab! Currently, we have four 3D printers and a cleaner for support materials. Our 3D Printing team has benefitted our greatyly in the past, we'v printed buckets, wheels, smokestacks, ram-heads, and even Buddhas with Batman heads! Currently, our 3D Printing team is working on the Alpha Team construction, as there is not much to be printed this year for competition. This has not stopped them, however! The 3D printing team has created new wheels, upon which they will add special grips, to aid in their ascent on the ramp!", "http://micdsrobotics.com/img/dummies/blog/3DTeam.jpg"];
$post3 = ["A Robotics Thanksgiving!","This year, for our annual MICDS Turkey Train event, our robot managed to carry a turkey for a school record breaking run of about 300 meters! Although our goal each year has been to make it all the way to the Mac, our robots have always found difficulty either traversing the stairs, the long inclines, or simply lasting long enough on a single battery. This year our Robot made it farther than ever, but, unfortunately, its battery ran out on the straightaway just before the descent to the Mac! ''Next Year!'' has become the unfortunate battlecry of the Robotics Team, but with results like these, I'm inclined to believe that we'll pull a Turkey all the way to the Mac for sure! For those of you who are unfamiliar with MICDS's Turkey Train tradition, the Turkey Train is an event held each year where the students pass Turkeys from the Upper School into the Mac where they are shipped to food banks! Here's a video of the event made by our Ram Report:","http://micdsrobotics.com/img/dummies/blog/TurkeyTrain.jpg"];
$post4 = ["The Robotics Community","Our team has become very close friends that readily accepts new members into its close atmosphere. I was new this year and was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to fit in with them. I was instantly put on a project and taught what to do. Of course I am still learning but I cannot learn how to build a robot in one night. It is such a diverse team that does not care who you are, where you have come from, or what you have done. Our school does not have a good reputation for being very diverse, but our team goes against that statement by a long shot. It is not completely overrun by guys and people whose origins do come from all over the world. We do things within smaller groups to get more projects done: however, we will often come together outside of our scheduled time for robotics. We have gone out to see movies, get food, play games, and even come in during one of our days off to help each other catch up on our deadlines. For a while I was scared of joining robotics because I was not sure that they would accept me, someone who has never done anything like this in their life and has absolutely no clue what they are doing. I was wrong and wished I joined sooner. I have had tons of fun hear while listening to music played over the speakers overhead and doing whatever needs to be done.","http://micdsrobotics.com/img/dummies/blog/Kristin.jpg"];
$post5 = ["Teamwork","In this 2015-2016, I've really enjoyed working with different people who have different strengths and weaknesses. Initially, it was difficult being productive because we were trying to organize teams and placing people in appropriate groups. However, after a week or two, our team was able to work efficiently in our programming and construction groups. For our construction group, we began to have a routine where a few people would help plan out what it was that the team needed to finish by the end of the day. Then there were others who would help with the design and help with the actual programming of the robot. One example of where we had to use teamwork was during the process of building the robot. Whenever one person needed specific materials, he or she would assign others to collect the parts in order to be more efficient. In addition, since there are many functions and applications of a robot, it was important that we had multiple people working at different parts of the robot at the same time. This in itself posed a problem because we had difficulty collaborating with teammates in order to make sure we were on the same page. Thus, we made sure to check regularly with the team in the beginning of sessions to make sure all parts of the team have clear goals.","http://micdsrobotics.com/img/dummies/blog/NiemaCommunity.jpg"];
$post6 = ["Mentoring Rampunzel","This year, we have been mentoring an FTC team at our school, #9905 Rampunzel. Rampunzel is an all-girls robotics team whose mission is “To inspire young women to stand up for what they believe in and become prominent into the STEM fields.” They are a brand new team with almost entirely new members, ranging from grade 7-12. We have helped them learn the basics of robot building, teaching them to use all the tools and assemble a stable chasee. We also helped them set up Android Studio for their programming. They have specifically cited one of our team members as their mentor in their Engineering Notebook. Overall, it’s been a great experience getting to know and help the team.","http://micdsrobotics.com/img/dummies/blog/MentorRamp.png"];
$post7 = ["FLL Team Outreach","Our team has been extremely dedicated to helping the FLL program. We mentored a local FLL team, Odyssey 2.0 from Word of Life Lutheran School. They were a new team and didn’t know what to expect when they reached competition. We came to two of their practices and walked them through what their competition would look like. We ran mock trials of their three judging sessions, Core Values, robot judging, and project judging. We also gave them a few tips for programming in EV3. It was good practice for us because we gained practical experience for when we volunteer at the FLL competitions. We had the whole team volunteer at two FLL qualifiers that were held at MICDS. The school was desperately looking for volunteers because they had very few signed up. We rallied together and got as many volunteers as we could and ended up being very helpful in the whole operation of the day. We even had 3 team members serve as referees! It was lots of fun being there and we got to see the team we mentored in action! ","http://micdsrobotics.com/img/dummies/blog/FLLNov.png"];
$post8 = ["Things to Come","We have lots of events we are still planning, or going to do later in the year. This year our FTC team decided we wanted to reach out to our community by inspiring youth to pursue STEM in their education and someday, careers. Recently, we reached out to the Disruption Department. Their goal is to make sure all children have the opportunity to learn STEM in a high tech manner. We are hoping to not only work with the company, but to also advance our technological skills. Hopefully, this partnership will begin working together in the near future. After mentoring the FLL team, we realized how much younger kids look up to teenagers. This inspired us to seek out more opportunities like this. We came into contact with a Jr. FLL coach at MICDS and talked to her about what we could do to become more active in this program. We decided that we were going to coach a team! We will start this in the 2016 Jr. FLL season. We will mentor a current team of 3rd graders. In the next year we will start a new team with 1st graders. Our goal is to make a partnership between FTC and Jr. FLL at our school that will become a tradition. ","http://micdsrobotics.com/img/dummies/blog/Volunteer.png"];
